Restrictions apply for inbound and outbound travel. See below for more details.

#### Inbound Travel: Who can travel into Denmark?

Travelers entering Denmark are encouraged to take a COVID–19 test at border crossings. Foreigners who want to enter Denmark and those who show clear symptoms of COVID–19, such as dry cough and fever, will be refused entry at the border. 

As of June 15, 2020, restrictions will be lifted for travelers from Norway, Germany, and Iceland. Upon entry to Denmark, they will have to present proof of a hotel, holiday home or camp site reservation outside the capital Copenhagen for at least six consecutive nights. Overnight stays will be banned for tourists in Copenhagen, but they will be able to visit the city for day trips.

Travelers who do not need to commit to a minimum of six nights outside Copenhagen include residents of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, or Skåne, Halland or Blekinge in Sweden.

With the exception of travelers coming from the abovementioned countries, all inbound travelers are required to undergo a 14–day quarantine.
