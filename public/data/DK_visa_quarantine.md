- Due to the restrictions on entry into Denmark, it is temporarily not possible to apply for a visa to Denmark. 

- Applications for business visas can be handed in 6 months prior to the planned trip.

- It is not possible to modify the issued visa, so travelers must apply for a new visa for the time of travel.
