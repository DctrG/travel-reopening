Domestic travel is partially allowed. Certain high-risk districts remain under lockdown and movement is restricted in these areas.

The following measures apply:

- [Leisure travel on domestic flight routes is suspended](https://www.philippineairlines.com/en/ph/home/covid-19/reentryflights) until further notice.

- High-risk districts, such as Cebu City, are placed under strict Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). Under ECQ, all non-essential travel is restricted and non-essential businesses may not operate.
- Other districts remain under General Community Quarantine (GCQ), which sees some restrictions ease slightly. [Click here](https://www.covid19.gov.ph/ecq-gcq-guidelines/) for ECQ and GCQ guidelines. Refer to the [Philippine News Agency](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1105983) for a list of areas that these guidelines affect.
- Social distancing measures should be observed and face masks should be worn in public.
