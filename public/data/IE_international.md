Restrictions apply for inbound and outbound travel. See below for more details.

#### Inbound Travel: Who can travel into Ireland?

The Irish Authorities require travelers coming into Ireland, apart from Northern Ireland, to undergo 14-day self-isolation.

Travelers, including Irish residents, arriving to Ireland from overseas, will need to complete a mandatory [Public Health Passenger Locator Form](https://www.gov.ie/locatorform). Travelers will need to submit it to relevant authorities at their port of entry. Exemptions are in place for providers of essential supply chain services such as hauliers, pilots, and maritime staff.
