Starting on 15 June, self–isolation is recommended for all those arriving in Finland who come from countries that are still subject to internal or external border control. Such countries include Sweden, Germany, and Russia. Self-isolation is not required if the person arrives from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Denmark, or Iceland. 

Guidelines on self–isolation can be found on the [Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare](https://thl.fi/fi/web/infektiotaudit-ja-rokotukset/ajankohtaista/ajankohtaista-koronaviruksesta-covid-19/matkustaminen-ja-koronaviruspandemia).
