The **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** has provided the following general guidelines for travelers in the US:

* Non–essential travel outside of your local community is discouraged.
* Should travel be required, it is advised to check the [number of cases](https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#cases) at your destination, observe safe social distancing, and [use public transportation safely](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/using-transportation.html). 
* When in public, wear a [cloth face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html).

Individual states and territories may have their own restrictions in place, such as shelter–in–place orders, mandated quarantines, or border closures. While restrictions have started to [ease across the country](https://www.usatoday.com/storytelling/coronavirus-reopening-america-map/), it is important to **check individual [state or local health department websites](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) for details before traveling**.
