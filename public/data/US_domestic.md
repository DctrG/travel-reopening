Individual states and territories may have their own restrictions in place, such as shelter-in-place orders, mandated quarantines, or border closures. Refer to the [USA Today resource](https://www.usatoday.com/storytelling/coronavirus-reopening-america-map/) on the reopening status across all states for detailed information.

The **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** has provided the following general guidelines for travelers in the US:

- Non-essential travel outside of your local community is discouraged.
- Should travel be required, it is advised to check the [number of cases](https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#cases) at your destination, observe safe social distancing, and [use public transportation safely](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/using-transportation.html).
- When in public, wear a [cloth face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html).

Before embarking on interstate travel, it is important to check individual [state or local health department websites](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) for updates.
