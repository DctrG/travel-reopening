#### Inbound Travel: Who can travel into Iceland?

**Travel restrictions apply.** Iceland's borders have remained open to citizens of other EU and Schengen states throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, under the condition that passengers quarantine for 14 days from their day of arrival. As of June 15, passengers, who are allowed to travel to Iceland, can choose to be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival. From this date, passengers can opt for a COVID-19 test upon arrival, as an alternative to quarantine.

The Government has announced that all passengers arriving in Iceland from 15 June can choose to [be tested for COVID-19 (free of charge for an initial two-week period) or quarantine for two weeks](https://www.government.is/news/article/2020/06/05/Information-for-travellers-arriving-in-Iceland-from-15-June-2020/). From 1 July, passengers will pay ISK 15 000 for a single test. Children born in 2005 or later are exempt from both testing and quarantine.

#### Outbound Travel: Who can travel out of Iceland?

Icelanders are advised not to travel abroad.
