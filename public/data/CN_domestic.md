#### Mainland China

Individual states and territories implement their own measures that may impact interstate travel.

Refer to the most updated travel policies for domestic travel in China for Beijing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shandong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Daqing, and Ha'erbin [here](https://www.europeanchamber.com.cn/en/national-news/3188/travel_policies_to_and_from_cities_in_china).

These travel restrictions are often determined by:

- travel from high–risk areas in China
- travel from middle–risk areas in China
- travel from low–risk areas in China
- travel from Hubei Province
- health codes from provinces
