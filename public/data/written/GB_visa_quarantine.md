There are self-isolation protocols in place.

You may not be required to self-isolate if you enter the United Kingdom from a territory or country that is on the 'travel corridor' exemption list. Exemptions differ across [England](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors), [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-countries-and-territories-exemptions), [Wales](https://gov.wales/exemptions-self-isolation-coronavirus-covid-19-html), and [Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-health-checks-at-borders/pages/exemptions/). These lists are constantly being reviewed.
