Domestic travel in Jamaica is partially allowed; tourism has started opening in phases. Under the **Controlled Entry Programme for 2020 July 1 – 31**, [tourists may only travel within the **designated Resilient Corridor**](https://www.jtbonline.org/wp-content/uploads/FAQs-for-Re-Opening-July-10.pdf).

- Currently, the Resilient Corridor runs [from Negril along the north coast to Portland](https://www.jtbonline.org/wp-content/uploads/FAQs-for-Re-Opening-July-10.pdf). All tourists must stay within the Corridor at all times.
- Only accommodation properties on the beach side of the Resilient Corridor are allowed to operate, and they must hold a COVID-19 Compliant Certificate to accept guests.
- Other types of travelers, such as business travelers, may be subject to different domestic travel rules. [Click here](https://www.jtbonline.org/wp-content/uploads/JTS-Bulletin-16-for-July-2-1.pdf) to find out more.
