- Travelers from EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are exempt from this requirement.

- All persons entering Germany from third countries (third countries are countries outside the European Union) are required to remain in two-week self-quarantine.

- If it is determined that the infection rate in that country is low, the quarantine requirement will not apply to the traveler entering from a third country. The names of these countries will be published on the website of the [Robert-Koch-Institut](https://www.rki.de/DE/Home/homepage_node.html).
