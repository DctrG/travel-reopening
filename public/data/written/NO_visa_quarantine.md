Travelers entering Norway must quarantine for 10 days from the date of arrival. This rule does not apply to travelers returning from countries in Europe with low infection rates. A list of these countries can be found [here](https://www.fhi.no/en/op/novel-coronavirus-facts-advice/facts-and-general-advice/travel-advice-COVID19/). This list is updated frequently as infection rates change.
