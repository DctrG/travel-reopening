#### Inbound Travel: Who can travel into Tunisia?

Tunisia has reopened the [country's air, sea, and land borders](https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/355241/tunisia-air-sea-and-land-borders-reopen-june-27-update-13).

The government has categorized countries into three zones â€“ red, orange, and green, based on the number of cases and epidemiological situation in each country. Countries not specified as "green" or "orange" are listed as "red."

This list is revised every few days on the [Observatoire National des Maladies Nouvelles et Emergentes Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ONMNE/).

**"Red list" countries**: Only Tunisians and those who hold a permanent residency may enter from red countries.

 **"Orange list" countries**: Tunisians and tourists may enter Tunisia if they provide a negative COVID-19 lab test. The test results must be received within 72 hours, and the analysis must be conducted no more than 120 hours before arrival to Tunisia.

**"Green list" countries**: All travelers may enter Tunisia without a COVID-19 test.

#### Outbound Travel: Who can travel out of Tunisia?

The government advises those who travel out of Tunisia to check with their individual destinations.
