Travelers coming from "red," "orange," and "green" countries are required to undergo different quarantine restrictions:

**"Red list" countries**: Tunisian national and permanent residence holders must quarantine in mandatory quarantine centers for seven days. They will be subject to screening tests on the 6th day.

 **"Orange list" countries**: Travelers entering from "orange list" countries will be advised to undergo a two-week voluntary self-quarantine. Those who choose not to undergo a COVID-19 test will be held in [quarantine for at least three days](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/28/c_139244692.htm) until the health ministry carries out the appropriate tests.

**"Green list" countries**: No testing or quarantine requirements.
