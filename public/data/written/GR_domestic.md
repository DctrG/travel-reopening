#### Travel Between Islands

Travel by ferry to and from islands is permitted.

Before boarding for trips longer than 30 minutes, travelers are required to complete a health status questionnaire and submit to a temperature check. They must also wear a mask. The form is available in [English](https://gr.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/206/form-in-english-for-greek-island-ferries.pdf) and [Greek](https://gr.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/206/form-in-greek-for-greek-island-ferries.pdf), on most ferry operator websites, and at the ports.

Certain flights to islands are operational. To obtain information about flight schedules and possible travel restrictions, do contact the airlines directly.
