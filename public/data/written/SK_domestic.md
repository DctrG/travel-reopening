Domestic travel is allowed as the official state of emergency in Slovakia has ended. Masks must be worn outside one's home, and social distancing measures are still in place.

Generally applied measures include:

- The wearing of face masks outside one's home.
- People are required to stand at least 2 meters away from each other when queuing indoors and outdoors.
- Obligatory contactless temperature taking at entrances to establishments.
