Restrictions apply for inbound and outbound travel. See below for more details.

#### Inbound Travel: Who can travel into Switzerland?

As of **June 15, 2020**, entry is **allowed** for all citizens of Switzerland and citizens of [Schengen states](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/einreise/einreise-ch-schengen.html).

Entry is also allowed for:

- All persons with rights of free movement from non–Schengen states, such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Romania.
- Third–country travelers who do not require a visa and are already a legal resident in the Schengen area.
- Third–country travelers who require a visa but who hold a residence document issued by a Schengen state and who are therefore already a legal resident in the Schengen area.

Entry is **not allowed** for those arriving from high–risk countries unless they meet certain requirements and are able to produce specific documents at the border. High–risk countries are all countries outside the Schengen states.
