From **July 1, 2020**, the international travel ban is expected to be lifted. Until this time, the [Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT)](https://www.caat.or.th/en/archives/50437) has banned all international flights to Thailand.

#### Outbound Travel: Who can travel out of Thailand?

Due to the current entry ban on international flights, very few commercial flights currently operate out of Thailand and are subject to cancellation without notice. Contact your airline for advice.
