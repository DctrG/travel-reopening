Restrictions apply for inbound and outbound travel. See below for more details.

#### Inbound Travel: Who can travel into China?

**Travel restrictions apply.** In view of the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world, China has decided to temporarily suspend the entry into China by foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits still valid to the time of this announcement, effective from  28 Narch 2020.

- Entry by foreign nationals with APEC Business Travel Cards will be suspended as well. Policies including port visas, 24/72/144-hour visa-free transit policy, Hainan 30-day visa-free policy, 15-day visa-free policy specified for foreign cruise-group-tour through Shanghai Port, Guangdong 144-hour visa-free policy specified for foreign tour groups from Hong Kong or Macao SAR, and Guangxi 15-day visa-free policy specified for foreign tour groups of ASEAN countries will also be temporarily suspended. 
- Entry with diplomatic, service, courtesy or C visas will not be affected. Foreign nationals coming to China for necessary economic, trade, scientific or technological activities or out of emergency humanitarian needs may apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates. 
- Entry by foreign nationals with visas issued after this announcement will not be affected.

According to the [European Chamber of China](https://www.europeanchamber.com.cn/en/national-news/3205/progress_made_regarding_return_of_foreign_nationals_to_china), supporting measures to facilitate the return of foreign nationals to China for urgent/necessary purposes are being conducted at a local level, including in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanghai, and Tianjin.

In Shanghai, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the Shanghai Municipality Government have issued [two channels](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5p9aRAGHT2WlnUB11toj7A) – a normal channel and a fast track channel – to facilitate the entry into China of employees essential for business operations.

The fast track channel is only applied to employees of companies whose country of origin has signed a fast track agreement with China. Employees entering Shanghai following the fast track procedure will be allowed to start work within 48 hours after arrival, subject to negative COVID-19 test results. Those entering Shanghai following the normal procedure will be subject to a 14-day quarantine at a designated central facility. Please check our article [here](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-travel-restrictions-special-visa-applications/) to understand the detailed application procedures.

Various countries’ embassies and chambers of commerce have been negotiating with the Chinese government to establish fast track channels. By far, China has signed fast track agreements with Germany, France, South Korea, [UK](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/22/c_139080064.htm?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0), [Japan](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UZnuu0asTLbd0_cl8lGYkQ), and Singapore.

#### Outbound Travel: Who can travel out of China?

**Travel restrictions apply.** On June 4, the CAAC said it would [allow](http://www.caac.gov.cn/PHONE/XXGK_17/XXGK/TZTG/202006/t20200604_202928.html) all foreign airlines, including those which were barred from operating flights to China, to choose from a list of approved cities to operate on one international passenger flight a week beginning June 8. The announcement came right after the US Trump administration issued [an order](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2020-06/China Part 213 Phase Order 20120-6-1 Final.pdf) to suspend Chinese airlines, including Air China, China Eastern, and China Southern to operate direct passenger flights to the US beginning June 16 (if it’s not going to be advanced).
