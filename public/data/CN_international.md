#### Inbound Travel: Who can travel into China?

**Travel restrictions apply.** Mainland China has suspended entry by foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits still valid as of March 28, 2020.

According to the [European Chamber of China](https://www.europeanchamber.com.cn/en/national-news/3205/progress_made_regarding_return_of_foreign_nationals_to_china), supporting measures are underway to facilitate the return of foreign nationals to China for urgent/necessary purposes. These include the cities of Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanghai, and Tianjin.

In Shanghai, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the Shanghai Municipality Government have issued  a [normal channel and a fast track channel](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5p9aRAGHT2WlnUB11toj7A) to facilitate the entry into China of employees essential for business operations.

The fast track channel is only applicable to employees of companies from Germany, France, South Korea, [UK](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/22/c_139080064.htm?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0), [Japan](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UZnuu0asTLbd0_cl8lGYkQ), and Singapore that has signed a fast track agreement with China.
