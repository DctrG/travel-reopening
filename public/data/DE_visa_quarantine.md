- The federal and state governments have agreed that all persons entering Germany from third countries are required to remain in self-quarantine for two weeks. Third countries are countries outside the European Union (EU). Persons traveling from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are exempt from this requirement, as are persons traveling from EU countries.

- The quarantine requirement does not apply to persons entering from a third country if it is determined that the infection rate in that country is low. The names of these countries will be published on the website of the [Robert-Koch-Institut](https://www.rki.de/DE/Home/homepage_node.html).
