If you are Canadian or a permanent resident, and you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you may still enter Canada by land, rail, or sea. You may not enter Canada by air, to protect the health of all travelers.

If you have symptoms, you must isolate for 14 days. This is mandatory.

If you have recently returned to Canada and you have no symptoms, you must quarantine (self-isolate) for 14 days.
