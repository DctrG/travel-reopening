- By law, if a traveler arrives in Ireland from any other country than those allowed, the traveler will need to fill in a form called the COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form. This includes Irish citizens coming home, people with no symptoms, and people who have tested negative for the virus in another country. 

- The traveler will also be asked to [self–isolate for 14 days](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/travel.html#self-isolation-after-travel).
