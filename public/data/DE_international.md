Restrictions apply for inbound and outbound travel. See below for more details.

#### Inbound Travel: Who can travel into Germany?

**Travel restrictions apply.** EU citizens and citizens of the United Kingdom, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland, and the family members of these citizens, are permitted to return to their home country or to their place of normal residence in Germany or another country.

This also applies to third-country nationals with long-term residence permits, including long-stay visas, who are returning to their place of normal residence. 

Travelers will no longer be checked at the borders with Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Denmark. As a result of joint consultations, temporary border control for air travel from Spain will end in both countries on 21 June 2020. This decision means that travelers from other EU countries will no longer need a valid reason for entering Germany.

#### Outbound Travel: Who can travel out of Germany?

**Travel restrictions apply.** The Federal Minister of the Interior urges citizens not to travel unless it is absolutely essential.
