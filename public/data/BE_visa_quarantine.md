- For the time being and until further notice, Belgian embassies and consulates no longer accept any visa applications and no longer issue visas, except in exceptional cases (essential travel). In most countries, the Visa Application Centres are also closed.

- The examination of visa applications already submitted continues. However, in the event of a positive decision, the visa will not be issued immediately, except in exceptional cases (essential travel).

- People with a valid visa are strongly advised to postpone any non-essential travel and to travel when the situation is normalized.
