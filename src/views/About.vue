      <h1>About Project Travel Reopening</h1>
      <p>
        Project Travel Reopening is a free and open source project by TourHero. It provides an
        up-to-date view of travel restrictions around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We
        hope this information will be useful to individuals who require insights
        into the global situation in planning their travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our data is pulled from multiple sources including official government
        websites and news outlets. Selecting a country will display detailed information on domestic
        travel, international travel, and visa and quarantine regulations current
        to the destination, as well as relevant links to sources.
      </p>

      <h2>How You Can Contribute</h2>
